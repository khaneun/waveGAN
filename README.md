# waveGAN
This project is aiming to try the module implementation based on the paper named "Synthesizing Audio with Generative Adversarial Networks" written by Chris Donahue et al. once as practice. Actually this module already has been implemented by authors at their Github(https://github.com/chrisdonahue/wavegan)

For this, let's take look at SpecGAN.
